<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>As you noticed. My blog haven't been updated in a while, this is due to a new off-time job I got and due to the fact I'm finishing my bachelor (in Computer Science) at the moment.</p>
<p>I decided to make this blog post, as it frustrates me the lack of knowledge people have of their body -- and in this case their feet. I'm not saying everyone should run barefoot, or be this caveman-ish kind of guy -- you can freely choose to walk and run around in shoes, but you need to know how it affects you. Obviously not everyone can be dedicating their life to anatomy and biomechanics, nor do I, but I'm just a curious engineer student who learned to listen to his body.</p>
<p>All the anatomy arguments here are first of all scientific, however that doesn't lower their validation -- as they prove som significant points.</p>
<p>When running "perfectly" you use all your biomechanics from your hips down right to your big toe. People running in minimalist shoes or barefoot often refer to the term "spring", as in "Use your spring(s)!" (ie: your legs), as it's one solid kind of functionality in your body. Just to clarify, it's not. "The spring" is a set of body parts that can create mobility, e.g. hips, knees, ankles. To improve "your spring", you need to enhance your ability to use the flexibility of ALL these components, and that takes some time. Anyhow, the important part of this article is actually about the foot itself. It is probably obvious to everyone, that your hips, knees, and ankles can flex -- but what most people doesn't know, is your foot actually flexes aswell!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My foot is rock solid, I've played football for years and surely it's hard as a rock" -- Maybe it feels that way, and shoes surely does make your feet more "clumpy" but it actually still have some unique flexibility hidden within it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand the basic anatomy of your foot, from a running perspective, you need to look at your fingers. Remember that your feet, have the same ground skeleton structure as your hands! Hands consist of long bones, that supports the fingers -- and so does your toes aswell! Imagine instead of having this sort of padding between each finger, then instead it was filled with muscles like the core of the hand, all the way to the tip. Yeah, that's right.... then your hand roughly looks like your foot. With that in mind, I want you to try a small exercise. Place your fingers on opposite arm, keep them together and relax. You should now keep relaxing the fingers, and make sure they are all lined up as close as they can to each other. Now try applying pressure by twisting the wrist towards the arms. You should now feel that your fingers is trying to spread, if not, then you're simply tensioning them too much. When you "understand" or can see this concept, you can apply the same to your foot. Your foot works exactly the same way, when you land on your ball while you run. The "toe bones" starting form the ankle going right to the end of each toe actually try to separate. This is a mechanism to absorb impact, and also one of the core reasons why you should land on your ball, and not your heel. So this actually means, that when you land on your foot, it becomes wider right on impact. Now imaging wrapping your foot in tape, very tight, and try to run. The idea doesn't sound nice right? That's exactly how shoes affect your running, they often sit tight around your foot and disables your foot from flex correctly.</p>
<p>"Imaging starting everyday by grabbing a pair of mittens, and wear them all day until you hit your bed again. Doesn't sound nice? The exact same scenario is what you do to your feet when wearing shoes" -- Thomas Kobber Panum</p>
<p>The obvious answer to the previous statement is "Just make the running shoes wider, so you can flex properly" -- yes, but then another problem arises. Then you'll end up sliding around inside of the shoes, due to the friction between you and the ground. Obvious the better runner you are, the less friction -- but it'll catch up to you at some point, it's just all about a matter of distance.</p>
<p>There are also other issues to address about shoes, but this is one of the core ones -- and the one scaring me the most from running in shoes. Running in shoes, is exactly like wearing mittens for your hands. Limits you in exactly the same ways.</p>

<p>"But but but, there's rough asphalt and it screws up my feet" -- This is due to you not having proper running technique. Getting it is not easy, and you might get some blisters along the way. I have, and I didn't need to, but that's a part of being a stubborn human.</p>
