<p>This post is kinda mixed, there's some about cycling, some about running and lastly a nice track to wrap it all up.</p>
<p>I went for my first outdoor bikeride this year, yesteday. I've always had some hate against post-drinking workouts. It seems there's always this one dummy workout, where you have to <em>sweat out the alchohol, </em>and after that you can continue with your normal workout plan. It's just always there, it doesn't help waiting a few days after you've been drinking. It's like a pimple, it just sits there and waits for you to pop it. Oh well, nevertheless back to the real story. I text'ed my old spinning buddy, if he wanted to go for a outdoor ride. My favorite workout to do while being a bit hungover is to ride home and visit my parents, knowing when I arrive there'll be a big feast. I live about 50 kilometers from my parents, so it's a nice soft ride. Anyhow, he answered 'Yeah', and we decided to visit my parents.</p>
<p>Even though google maps decided to guide us through about 3 kilometers of rock/dirt road while being on my racing bike, it was a nice ride. My enjoyment for outdoor workouts and cycling, just got refreshed. I have a lot <em>self-claimed-strong-athlete</em> people questioning why I love biking, and how I can find such a <em>weak</em> exercise exciting? Most people think of cycling as a way of getting from A to B, and surely that's the reason why the bicycle got invented in this first place. BUT, after many years of researching some true at-first hidden qualities of the bike was discovered. The biking causes almost no damage on ligaments and bones. So what does it mean? When riding a bike, you almost exclusively use your muscles and don't rely on your foot or knees to have some certain strength. Obviously you can argue that a strong knee is needed in some ultra intensive scenarios.</p>
<p>You believe you feel strong? Have you ever tried pounding on a well-assembled racebike? If not, you surely haven't experienced your bodys strongest muscle in action. People doing weightlifting usually love the intensity, and feel of blood pumping in and out of their muscles. But if they really enjoy that, why not experience the ultimate blood-pump-rush? The feeling of accelerating on your bike, while your thighs starts soaking more and more blood, feels... just amazing. Biking doesn't have to be this non-sweating boring excises, if you feel it's too weak, then it's surely you not pushing yourself.</p>
<p>Enough with all the biking, not really any excited progress. My barefoot running range expanded to 2 kilometers on the <em>Dreadmill </em>today. I read a small article about <a href="http://www.runbare.com/359/barefoot-running-on-treadmill-challenges/" target="_blank">running barefoot on a treadmill</a> that Jeff Gallup linked in the comments in my previous post. Some of the points is quite obvious, however, I found the point about starting off with a very high incline helped. During my run today, I started off rather slow with very high incline (~7%) and then went slowly down and add some speed as I went down. I didn't go below 1% incline, as it helps stimulate a lot of muscles in your lower leg, compared to running totally flat. My soles got a bit sour, like they always do, but it wasn't as bad as it used to be. Like there's people who doesn't understand bikers, I didn't understand runners at first. Not until I started running barefoot. Every time I go home from the gym, I think about how much I loved the workout I just completed. Not in the "good"-old shod-days, where the first thought that came to mind was <em>"finally, it's over, hopefully this will be enjoyful someday"</em>.</p>

<p>My Injinji-socks arrived friday and I've now been using them at home for three days. They're kinda special, but when you have worn them for a while, you love them. I should properly have bought the outdoor model, but hopefully the Plasti Dip will take some of the cold from the ground aswell. Friday I went to basically every DIY-store in town: no Plasti Dip, no where! I even went to special toy stores asking for it, but no help. So I went home and ordered a can from a boat store in Denmark, hopefully it'll arrive soon so I can try out these goodies in the field.</p>

<p>I went for a walk the other day, with my iPod on shuffle in my pretty-big house library. Suddenly this track reminded me so much of being a newbie barefoot runner. It's a fantastic track, made by a friend of mine.</p>
