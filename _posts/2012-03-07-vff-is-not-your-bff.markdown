<p>I'm currently writing this blog post, with my feet taking an exclusive footbath after todays training. I'm still running 1.5K, and currently visiting blister heaven. I'm curious if I'm going on too hard, but at least I feel I improve every time I visit the <em>Dreadmill</em> (Read: Treadmill). The <em>feetback*</em> concept that Ken Bob talks about in his book is really getting to me, when I ran in shoes I typically wanted to take a look at my feet inorder to see the movement of them. Nowadays I feel it's absolutely pointless to look down, as my feet tells me exactly how they're doing. This leads to me relaxing more, and getting overall better form due to that. I also decided to quit running in my Newtons, and exclusively run barefoot instead of the semi-barefoot training I used to do (1,5K barefoot, 3,5K Newtons). The Newtons is great, and if you surely are a shod believer, I would recommend them, but due to their pad structure I believe they confuse my feet compared to when I run barefoot.</p>

<p>I really want to get out of the Dreadmill, so I started researching and kept reading Ken Bob's book, on how other barefoot runners cope with temperatures around zero. The most common answer from minimalist runners is '<em>Go get yourself a pair of Vibram FiveFingers (VFF)!</em>', however through out Ken Bob's book so far he've been warning quite a bit about VFF. I assume that's because it's the most natural choice, and yeah, it was also my thought when I wanted to go outside in the cold. In the later parts of Ken Bob's book I stumbled upon a guy named Dave. He had the exact same problem as me, living in Northern Carolina with temperatures regularly around zero while having a passing for barefoot running. He tried out the VFF, but didn't like them due to the stiffness despite the thin sole. It prevented him from toe-lifting, which if you're experienced barefoot runner know is alpha-omega. They also reduce the <em>feetback*</em> drastically, and he believed it was possible to get more <em>feetback*</em> through a sole. He 'invented' a new kind of shoe, or rather sock, himself. It's basically a Injinji sock, with Plasti Dip painted on the bottom inorder to give it some durability. Hearing (or rather reading) about this cool invention, I decided to order a pair of Injinji socks from the UK. They should be arriving tomorrow or friday, so I'm really looking forward to see if I can get Plasti Dip in my local DYI-store and to try out this new outdoor shoe.</p>
<p>A typical question, and mostlikely very common for barefoot runners, I get lately is 'Why'd want to barefoot run?'</p>
<p>The answer isn't simple, but the easiest way to make people understand: <em>Try it yourself! </em>I've never really been a good runner, but when I tried barefoot running, I was absolutely stunned with all the stability you gained. If you enjoy running in shoes, then barefoot running will most-likely be like heaven to you, at least it as for me. The fact that you don't have to buy $300 shoes compensating for you running incorrectly also really appealed to me. And to the last and properly the biggest reason I'm doing it: <em>I suck at it</em>. Wait... what? Yes, after my weight-loss it's hard to find physical limits or 'something to fight for' and the fact I can't just go out run a marathon barefoot combined with some other people on the globe can, really... drives me!</p>
<p>*<em>Feetback</em>: It's a concept introduced in Barefoot Running: Step by step (Ken Bob). It's basically the fact you can feel the ground with your soles, and adjust your running form to the feet-back you get from your feet.</p>
