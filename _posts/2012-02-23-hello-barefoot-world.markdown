<p>Hello out there,</p>
<p>If you read this post, you've magically found a way to my new blog. This will be a place where I'll be posting about: what I experience in my life, music I find worth sharing, topics that make me wonder, code that won't compile and my physical experiments. The first and most obvious question that comes to mind when you visit a blog, is usually why should you follow it? Firstly, I'm not trying to sell any product or trying to expose myself as main-shopping-street dancer, I'm just having fun with life - so maybe this blog will inspire you, on how you could have even more fun?</p>
<p>I just ticked 'Running' in the category column, so better get to it. I consider myself an experienced cyclist, I used to attend spinning 4-5 times a week, mountainbike in the weekends and occasionally take my roadbike for long tour. The last (and first) time I got my oxygen uptake measured it was 5609ml/min (which for non-sportfreak reader is in the category 'very fit', or 'very high'). Anyways, my plan for 2012 (or "new year's revolution") was to quit spinning and start focusing on outdoor exercising. I expected to spent more time on my new up-and-coming titanium mountainbike, and as something totally new... get good at running. I've been running a lot on-off the last 20 months, basically the times I felt for a break from cycling. Before that period, I used running as the last phase of my weightloss plan (which I mostlikely someday will describe in another post). My longest distance ever run is about 10km, together with a friend about 20 months back with a pase around 5:30-6:00. Now that I consider myself a rather fit athlete, the results isn't really stunning, so I took the challenge and started planning a running program for 2012.</p>
<p>The exact goal for my running this year, was to complete a half marathon (~21km). I talked to a great post-football friend from my regular spinning team about us running the half marathon together, and he instantly accepted the challenge. I've read (most-of) the famous ironman book 'Going Long', and by that knowledge I formed a suitable running program that should end by a half marathon in mid-May. We started off great, and enjoyed the non-snow weather here in Denmark, which is quite unusual for early January. However, after about 2 week I started getting some problems with the right side of my hip. I didn't really think much about it, and was surely convinced it was my almost 2 years old running shoes. Without seeming to feminine I happy went shopping (which men doesn't love shopping for new gear?) a new pair of running shoes. I went to my typical outdoor sport shop, had a running analysis that showed my right foot having some major landing issues. The shop owner then advised me to some supportive shoes with a hard piece of plastic in inner side of the sole. I was happy about getting new gear, so one of the first things I did when I came home was to call my running buddy. Off we went.</p>
<p>During the running session, I started feeling a bit of on my sole near my heel. I told my running buddy to go slow, as I have to get used to these new shoes. About 1km later, I was hobbling like I had some mental disorder. It was hurting quite a bit, so my running buddy could see my pain, so he suggested we walked for a bit. After walking about 400 meters, we decided to start running again. The pain didn't go away, I tried different running styles (longer steps, shorter steps), nothing helped. I ended up sucking up the pain, and ran home. When I came out of the shower, my foot and soles were hurting quite bad. I hobbled for about 30-60 minutes, and then the pain finally went away. Two days after, the next run was scheduled and I was a ready as ever. I was aware of the new shoes, so I notified my buddy about we maybe should do a shorter and slower run than usual. After about 500 meters I almost fell, as the pain came back. It wasn't like the first time, this time it was seriously hurting. Let's fast forward a bit, I end up figuring out I've overloaded my right foot, in corporation with my doctor. He gave me some gout pills, and sent me off to a running specialist. The running specialist concludes that I've gotten a wrong pair of shoes. The shoes fixed the issues I had with my left foot, but forced my right foot off-limits with the hard inner sole. So here I was unable to run for 10 days, so I brainstormed about how I could spent that time improving my running.</p>
<p>In the book 'Going Long' there's non-usual running methods mentioned (Chi and Pose running), I started investigating those -- as it stated you could become a more economic and faster runner by that. I eventually end-up studying the forefoot running technique. Being a high school graduent with physics, I surely saw the benefit of all the not-heel-strike thing, as it sort of tries to counter your wished movement. Luckily I got the chance to change my 'wrong shoes', to a new pair. Which led me to a pair of Newtons. For those who don't know the Newton shoes, it's basically a which is made inorder for you to land on forefoot by having shock-absorption in the front and a hard heel. Now knowing there was so much technique to forefoot running, it really inspired me to investigate it even more.</p>

<p>I then suddenly stumbled upon these strange caveman-ish guys, which claimed that barefoot running is the most enjoyable way to run. My first thought was 'Yeah right, go back to your cornfields and run in circles'. However, discussing running with a groupmate from the university, he told me to watch a TED video about running, which claimed the same thing. As TED being scientific videoes, I was really excited to see the video (<a title="Born to Run" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_mcdougall_are_we_born_to_run.html" target="_blank">video here</a>). I've now been running in my newtons for 3-4 weeks, but couldn't really get the barefoot thing out my head. Even after the TED video, I sort of dismissed the idea and I found it unrealistic to perform in Denmark due to the amount of asphalt. Now another star fell from the sky, I discovered the book 'Barefoot Running: Step by Step', which claimed to be the best book on the topic. So I thought, oh well science approves, so might as well read it. Being half through the book, I'm really shocked exciting it is to read. It surely boosted my motivation, and now my goal is to become a proper barefoot runner. Yesterday I went to my local gym, and I couldn't resist taking of my shoes and socks and try out the stuff from the book on the treadmill. While being stared down by the rest of the gym, I really enjoyed the ride. I started off with 1 km in my Newtons, and swapped to barefoot for 2 km and then back to Newtons for another 1 km. The first 1 km of being barefoot was absolutely fantastic, I've never felt so comfortable running both balancewise but also lust to enjoy 'the ride'. After the 2 km, my soles were really sour. I believe it's the fact that my soles are hardly barefooted, and only knowing 50% of the technique needed. Now the day after, my soles is still a bit sour, but surely walkable. I've never looked so much forward to my next run, hopefully at some point I'll get there -- I'll surely keep you posted.</p>
