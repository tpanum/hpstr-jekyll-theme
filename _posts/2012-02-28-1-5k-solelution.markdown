<p>Today was my third time running barefoot on a treadmill. I expanded my range to 1,5km and then continued the last 3,5km with my newtons. I was training in a new center, which had mirrors infront of the treadmills, which lead me to discover something interesting. From previous running analysis done at my previous shoe-pusher, I knew my right foot have always had some trouble landing straight. I always been pondering why it was that way, and it's mostlikely from a trafic accident I had when I was about 17. I lost a super tiny piece of my right elbow, but the knee was never scanned. Oh well, enough with all the conspiracy theories. My left foot is landing perfectly straight, however my right one seem to point a bit outwards.</p>
<p>When I was on the treadmill, I tried forcing it in to the right position, but felt a bit weird for my knee, almost like it bending inwards. I also felt some tension on the inside of my right thigh, so maybe it's just some untrained muscles I need to built up?</p>
<p>The reason why all this concerns me, is because I've felt some soreness on the sole of my right big toe, and because I received a blister at that exact spot. And by what Ken Bob describe, it should be sort of hard of getting that, when you're supposed to land ball first and then gently touch down with the toes. Another thing that really ponders in my head at the moment, is the sole soreness. I'm most-likely starting a bit tough by "already" running 1,5km and coming from no previous barefoot experience. But it still concerns me, if it's my technique being bad, or my soles being weak -- or maybe both. It's hard to conclude anything yet, with only 3 runs, but in a few weeks we'll see.</p>

<p>Edit: The picture looks worse than it is, my heel isn't blue. It's just my fancy attempt of using Hipstagram and filter adds more confusion than hipstaness.</p>
<p>Just to end with a few positive words: I absolutely love the stability barefoot running gives you, never ever in my life have I felt to comfortable running.</p>
