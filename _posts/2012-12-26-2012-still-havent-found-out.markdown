The year is coming to an end, and 'end-of-year-charts' are everywhere. They're cool, especially for me as an A&amp;R, as it's somewhat an conclusion on the previous year. Did the expectations of the "new sound" hold? How was Noir Music in all this? <!--more--> and so on. The great music released in 2012 was rather sparse. Often through out 2012, there were really drop dead periods and then suddenly a tsunami of incredible music splashed over the vinyl and digital sites. But I surely can't say I was disappointed, so much new, great and creative stuff have been put out there. It've been amazing to follow all the way, as when 2012 began the music scene was very shaky. Shaky in the way of the 80's inspired kind-of house sound was fading away, but noone really knew what the next 'big thing' was supposed to be. Luckily it got settle pretty quickly through out the summer as the Ibiza season was running. The 90's were and are back. Thanks to tracks like: George Fritzgerald -- Child, and NiCe7 -- Time to Get Physical ... just to name a few.</p>
<p>I won't make a chart of what I think are the best tracks of 2012, but rather reveal which I'll remember 2012 mainly by. The track gets me excited everytime, I prepare my 1210 for the stunning white vinyl which contains this fantastic track. The runner up for my 'track of the year' award, was this one:

<p>HNNY despite being a totally fresh artists, he delievers solidly. And this crazy idea of making a club version of a classical Xylophone based track, just shocks and excites me at the same. It's just super unique, and squirts with creativity. Keep an eye out for HNNY, don't sleep on him. Surely my 'rookie' of the year.</p>
<p>I love tracks that challenge my ears. I want something new, something different. I want something unique. The following track does all that. It's my monalisa of house music, I'm still not sure if the mood in the following track is sadness, excitement, joy or anger. Maybe it's just everything. I've walked countless times on the harbor listening to this, and it just never ever gets boring or "just okay". It strikes me, every fucking single time. It's fantastic for listening pleasure, it rips a dancefloor apart. It's a combination of two men I absolutely admire (no homo), which I'm luckily enough to spend my New Year's Eve together with, I'm obvious talking about:</p>

<p>It really wraps up 2012 as a year, very well. It was a mixture of a lot of new styles and genres, all mixed together. Not knowing where "to go". This track came out in April, which is rather early. But when I heard it the first time. I knew we were heading somewhere great.</p>
