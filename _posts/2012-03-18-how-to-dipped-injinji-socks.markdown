<p>Sorry for the slow update, there have been a lot of tasks flying around in my world. But finally I managed fight them all, anyways back to the tutorial.</p>
<p>This is my first tutorial, so please keep your guards a bit down. If there's anything unclear, shoot at the comment field. Let's get started.</p>
<p><strong>What?</strong></p>
<p><em>Dipped Injinji Socks</em> is a bad term I created myself, but it covers what we're talking about: A pair of Injinji socks sprayed with Plasti Dip on the sole. For the danish readers, Plasti Dip is a special kind of flexible and though rubber paint, that only can be bought in very special stores. I personally bought it at a boat shop, and no, I have no idea what they use it for.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>I know it might sound like I wear blinders, but the Ken Bob's book have some really great points, and the whole idea is purely stolen from it. In the book a guy named Dave, made a pair of socks covered with Plasti Dip on the sole, as he wanted to run "barefoot" despite the temperatures of around zero. It was before Vibram FiveFingers (VFFs) were invented, which explained the motivation for this crazy engineering. However, the noticeable thing was, Dave bought a pair of VFFs when they were first released and ended up going back to his homemade socks. He claimed the sole of the VFFs were too thick (despite it being rather thin compared to regular shods) and he lost the "ground feel", unlike in his socks. Anyone that ever tried running barefoot know that <em>feetback</em> is essential. Dave also mentioned that toe-lifting were hard in the VFFs, but that might have been improved in the newer models. Just like Dave, the climate in Denmark is sometimes (if not all the time) unstable and as I'm writing this blog there's about 5 degrees here, which I why I decided to try this invention.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need?</strong></p>
<p>A pair of toe socks:<em> I decided on Injinji, as I've heard they should be very comfortable, and because they have an outdoor model that included wool to help protect against the cold.</em></p>
<p>A bottle of Plasti Dip: <em>I used spray, but brushable Plasti Dip should do just fine.</em></p>
<p>Some patience: <em>Can be hard to get during cold weather :-)</em></p>

<p>The socks unboxed. I ended up getting confused in the jungle of Injinji models, so I got the "Performance Mini-Crew" version, even though I wanted the outdoor version.</p>

<p>The wonder material.</p>
<p><strong>What now?</strong></p>
<p>Find a lovely place outdoors. The next step is make sure you have something that can draw your attention for the next 60 minutes, the view might be enough for some, but I decided to bring my iPad. Now find a comfortable position where your soles doesn't touch the ground. Disarm your current footwear and put on your toe socks, and try not to touch the ground while wearing them, to make sure they're dirt-clean. If you go by spray, then start by spraying the soles of the socks and spray them twice. If you go by brush, just give them a nice layer, rather too thin than too thick. Now wait for about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Now we're ready for round 2. Don't get confused about the cloth on my angles, it was a silly attempt to protect myself from turning into a ninja turtle by the Plasti Dip, but they ended up getting struck anyhow. Do exactly like before, spray twice and wait another 30 minutes. Now you're basically done, take off the socks. The next step is to make the Plasti Dip totally settle, which takes about 12 hours, but that can happen indoors.</p>
<p><strong>How are they?</strong></p>
<p>This is my first pair, and I gotta say I love them. I've been wearing them straight for five days, and overall tried to wear them whenever possible. They're great for running, but barefooting should always be your prefered way to run, this is just a great alternative when the weather isn't allowing you to go barefoot. I've also been wearing mine instead of my everyday shoes, inorder to improve my walking technique. They're perfect for that as well, and love wearing them on campus. I even order another pair yesterday, as my mom wanted a pair.</p>

<p>This is how they look after about a week of use. Good luck with brewing a pair of your own :-)</p>
