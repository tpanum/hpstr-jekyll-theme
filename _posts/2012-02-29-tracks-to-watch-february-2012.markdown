<p>This post might be quite thin textwise, but hopefully the YouTube clips cover up for that. I'll list the tracks I think you should watch out for in the future, and what I believe will be topping the charts.</p>
<p><strong>French Fries - Yo Vogue</strong><br />

This track surely have some slamming. I discovered it rather late, but it seems very anticipated. From what I've been told, you can get it by signing up at <a href="https://www.drip.fm/dirtybird" target="_blank">dirtybird's paid promoservice</a>. Else you have to wait for the official release.</p>
<p><strong>Blond:ish - Lonely Days (Climbers Remix)</strong><br />

This EP just seems bombed. The original is great, hunter/game remix slams and the climber remix just... killed me. Perfect spring track, dark deep winter sound with energetic summer melody. Surely one of the best releases by Blond:ish ever!</p>

<p><strong>DeMarzo - Flip The Mattress</strong><br />

This is where I'd put my money, DeMarzo is one of the new names to keep an eye on. I think he'll blow 2012 away with his release, absolutely stunning and refreshing work.</p>

<p><strong>Finnebassen - If You Girl Only Knew</strong><br />

<p>The reactions speaks for it self, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAXXfcRSpHQ" target="_blank">the video on YouTube when Noir drops this beast</a>. The lovely vocals from 'Aaliyah' combined with this amazing bassline -- how can magic NOT happen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Infinity Ink - Infinity</strong><br />

From what've been told this is gonna get released on Hot Creations at some point in March. This surely reminds me of '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQWlZqIdHOM" target="_blank">Hot Natured - Forward Motion</a>', which is one of my absolute favorite tracks of all time. Hard to say if this will be rocking just as hard, but surely sounds promising.</p>

<p>Hope this inspired you, and teased you a little. Now back to the waiting game!</p>
