The act of 'getting things done' surly isn't trivial. There are countless examples of organization tools which soles purporse is to  help you 'getting things done', or in other words, increase your productivity.

The word productivity is a quality measure of being productive, which by Merriam-Webster is defined as:

> doing or achieving a lot : working hard and getting good results

In an software engineering context, 'good results' often refer to products that a valuable to the customer. However, thereby productivity can be seen as an efficiency measure of value over time for a given engineer.
As a new entrepreneur, creating a software product, this have been a problem that I've been struggling with for quite a while. The abstract form that innovate software ideas have can lead to overloads of uncertainty, when trying to concretezing the idea into a product.
Reasoning in an uncertain environment isn't trival, and can be time consuming. This combined with the fact that time is an important aspect of productivity, its easy to get 'trapped' in this complex decision making scenario.

This is a story of some techniques that have helped me to simplify, and overcome these problems, by learning 'The Act of Acting', when creating a start-up in a new area of business.
'The Act of Acting' is all about your ability to handle and manage complexity. How do you react, when faced with a problem there is no obvious solution to?
There's obviously not a single answer to this, as it various based on the problem. However, during my time at the university I have observed many different reactions to this.

I have observed brilliant engineering students and colleges, that simply avoid tasks in hope for others completing them, or change project details (Architecture, API, language...) to safely remove the task.
Changing project details can be a valid solution, since productivity is the efficiency of customer value over time, and thereby the change might lead to higher value in less time.
There have been times, in which I have personally tried to avoid receiving a task, in the hope of other completing it before the task is forced upon me.

It's clear that it is some mental barrier that causes this, or basically an attempt from our brains to ease the load upon us. As with most physiological things, this behavior is something we can train and improve.
These mental struggles that fight with our intention is common to everyone. An example from my personal life, is that I hate to lift weights at the gym, however I do know it would benefit my body's health condition.
This is actually here (at the gym), I learned to train and eventually remove my own mental struggles.

Whenever I entered the gym, I knew which body parts to train for the specific day. As with everything, I prefer some exercises over others. However, when trying to improve my 'productivity at the gym' I decided that: Every time, I got the thought of an exercise that I certainly did NOT want to perform in my head, I had to perform that next in the schedule. Overtime, this improved 'mental stamina' and still helps me at the gym today.

What does lifting have to do with software development? Not a lot, but I've tried to implement the same mentality in my everyday work flow. I do so using at least some tool, everyday, that requires me to deal with problem that is non-trivial to me.
Examples of this: I use Emacs as my everyday development environment (editor, shell, git, irc). With Emacs being the most extendable development environment around, ideas for which I can improve my work flow pops up daily.
Everyday I reserve one hour for improving my Emacs configuration, either by writing my own improvements or including and customizing others.

This have lead to have an irreplaceable and incomparable development environment, and drastically changed the way I think as a programmer and made me a more robust problem solver.
